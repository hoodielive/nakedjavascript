4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming 
Encapsulation: grouping functions and variables together into an object 
For example: 
# 1 the procedural way
	let baseSalary = 30_000; 
	let overTime = 10; 
	let rate = 20; 
	
	function getWage(baseSalary, overTime, rate) {
		return baseSalary + (overTime * rate) 
	} 

# 2 The objet oriented way 
	let employee = {
		baseSalary: 30_000, 
		overTime: 10, 
		rate: 20,
		getWage: function() {
			return this.baseSalary + (this.overTime * this.rate) 
		}, 
	};
